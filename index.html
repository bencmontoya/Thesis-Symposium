			<h2> Description:</h2>
			<p>In this episode, Ben takes a look at how music streaming services and social media platforms are changing artistry and the responsibility of audiences in a click-based music economy. By taking an in-depth look at Soundcloud rap icon XXXTentacion, this episode delves into post-#MeToo discourses of accountability and its role in the underground rap communities made possible through digital infrastructure like Soundcloud. This episode also starts to interrogate the role hyper-realism plays in rap music and the Digital Oral spaces that rely on manipulation of narrative and objectivity for political potency.</p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> Just as a warning, this story contains descriptions of violence and disturbing language.</p>

			<p >This is a story about rap music. But even more than that, it’s ultimately about the value of entertainment. And it starts with a 19-year-old named Jahseh Onfroy.
			</p>

			<p class="center" id="look-transcript"><b>MUSIC:</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=326&v=qku2WZ7aRYw" title="Look At Me!" >"Look At Me!"</a> by XXXTentacion</p>

			<blockquote id="look-cite" class="active"><i>Look at Me!</i> YouTube, uploaded by XXXTENTACION, Sept. 12, 2017, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=326&v=qku2WZ7aRYw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=326&v=qku2WZ7aRYw</a></blockquote>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> This is Onfroy, better known by his mouthful of a rapper name XXXTentacion.</p>

			<p class="center"><b>{name montage}</b></p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> We’ll call him Triple X for simplicity.


			<p id="posted-transcript">The song “Look At Me!” was <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/the-real-story-of-rapper-xxxtentacion-10410980" title="real story" >first posted to Soundcloud in 2016.</a> Seen by a few thousand or so people, but nothing special. And yet, within less than a year, this 19-year old kid from Broward, Florida had seized the music world by storm.</p> 

			<blockquote id="posted-cite" class="active"> Hitt, Tarpley. “The Real Story of South Florida Rapper XXXTentacion” in <i>Miami New Times</i>, 5 June, 2018. <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/the-real-story-of-rapper-xxxtentacion-10410980">https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/the-real-story-of-rapper-xxxtentacion-10410980</a></blockquote>


			<p>The track would crack the Top 40 nearly a year later and would eventually skyrocket Triple X into the mainstream. But only after the rapper was arrested for beating his pregnant girlfriend.</p>

			<blockquote id="breakfast-cite"> <i>Horrifying Details Surface In XXXTentacion's Domestic Abuse Case. </i> YouTube, uploaded by Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM, September 11, 2017, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oWCINoaoy4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oWCINoaoy4</a></blockquote>

			<p><b>Angela Vox:</b> He’s been charged with… Substantial time in prison.”</p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b>“This segment on the popular hip hop radio show, The Breakfast Club, perfectly captures the unique celebrity Triple X found on the other side of his abuse allegations.” </p>

			<p class="center"><b>CLIP:</b> Breakfast Club Segment:</p>

			<p><b>Angela Vox:</b> “According to the victim…”</p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b>Though Charlamagne’s response to these horrific details of abuse are far from delicate, he basically gets to the crux of Triple X’s fame. Yeah, he’s been accused of these things… but what’s his music like? Does his history entice you enough to click play? Or should his criminal record be enough to cancel him and anyone who works with him?</p>

			<p >Which feels kind of like a no-brainer. We're in the post #MeToo world. We're supposed to believe survivors of sexual assault and hold entertainers accountable. So this pattern of abuse and manipulation feels like it should be the end of any celebrity’s career. But this story doesn’t follow the usual formula: XXX's music didn't get punished — it got popular.</p>

			<p >Triple X leaned into the brash and aggressive persona through interviews, recorded phone calls behind bars and videos shared on social media. In one of his first interviews after being released on bond, he towed a peculiar line between supervillain and sensitive victim. </p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> When his first full-length album dropped in August of 2017, just months after “Look At Me!” became popular, the buzz behind him caused the album to debut at no. 2, putting him in direct competition with industry standards like J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar.</p>


			<p class="center"><b>MUSIC:</b> “Jocelyn Flores” by XXXTentacion</p>

			<p id="fans-transcript"><b>Ben Vox:</b> This album, 17, is full of somber and vulnerable confession. Its seen by fans as proof that behind the villain character existed an artist grappling with morality and mental illness. Fans gravitated to Triple X’s charisma and feelings of being misunderstood, believing that no matter what he had been accused of, the rapper was trying to change for the good. To them, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/what-the-rise-of-xxxtentacion-says-about-being-a-fan-today/" title="fans">Triple X represented a new kind of hyper-realistic artistry.</a> Something underground and raw that felt more real than the sanitized pop rap coming from mainstream artists like Drake.</p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b>He became an anti-hero for an underground rap community. An iconic symbol for young people who felt they knew the rapper better through Instagram live videos and song lyrics than through police records and court appearances.</p>

			<p><b>Michael Vox:</b>If you can say the most despicable shit in the coolest way possible, you have a future in this shit.</p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> This is Michael Penn the Second, a staff writer at the music website Vinyl Me, Please. He has also been rapping under the name CRASHprez for the past 12 years.</p>


			<p><b>Michael Vox:</b> As far as rap is concerned, I engage from a point of scholarship but at the end of the day, sometimes its not about that shit, it’s about being entertained.</p>


			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> As both a critic and a rapper, Michael has noticed a cultural shift. With the rise of social media, the music industry has transitioned to a stream-based economy of clicks, likes and retweets. It doesn’t take much to lure someone into watching a video or checking out a song and it only benefits the artist, even if not everyone who clicks actually agrees with them.</p>


			<p >The outlaw character in hip hop has always been seductive to listeners. The rise of gangsta rap in the 80s and 90s tapped into this counterculture trope. And people ate it up, craving an unfiltered rawness in their music. Today, social media makes it feel like artists are just a tap away, like we as the audience can truly know celebrities because we can see into their lives at any moment. Their character, their performance, is even more tied to the rest of their life because the rest of their life always has an audience. An audience that celebrates the outlaw, instead of punishing them for doing bad things.</p>


			<p id="sixnine-transcript" >Brooklyn rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine is <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tekashi-69-rise-and-fall-feature-777971/" title="69">another prime example of this kind of fame</a>. 6ix9ine had spent years of branding himself through gang affiliation and gun toting Instagram videos, which landed him millions of streams and high profile feature spots. But last year, the rainbow haired, raspy voiced 22-year old was charged with gang related racketeering and weapons charges, weeks before his new album was scheduled to be released. Instead of sinking his career, the album, Dummy Boy debuted at no.2 on the Billboard 200. </p>

			<blockquote id="sixnine-cite"> Witt, Stephen, “Tekashi 6ix9ine The Rise and Fall of a Hip-Hop Supervillain” in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, January 16, 2019, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tekashi-69-rise-and-fall-feature-777971/">https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tekashi-69-rise-and-fall-feature-777971/</a> </blockquote>


			<p><b>Michael Vox:</b> In a world where you can see motherfuckers die a meme joke on the same screen. In that world, how do you hold somebody’s attention as a rapper? That baselines don’t really hold nobody’s attention no more, so you gotta like up the ante as much as you can and then once you up the ante, you’ve got to sustain that shit. That’s how you get a 6ix9ine, that’s how you get a Triple X.” </p>


			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> Which brings up all sorts of questions about what actually IS real about these rappers. How much of this is simply attention-grabbing, click-baity, social media hype? How much of it is art, informed by lived experience? And what is the listener’s responsibility in all this when just clicking play has the potential to line the pockets of problematic artists?</p>


			<p><b>Michael Vox:</b> Do we accept a certain baseline of hypocrisy by engaging with this?”</p>

			<p><b>Ben Vox:</b> “This is the moral relativity that has given rise to rappers like Triple X, Kodak Black and 6ix9ine. They’re all convicted criminals. They also all have big industry cosigns and top charting albums. Or had. </p>

			<p class="center"><b>{Death montage}</b></p>

			<p id="death-transcript"><b>Ben Vox:</b> Triple X <a href=" https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-shot-dead-at-20/" title="death">died in the summer of 2018</a>. A few months before, his second album, ?, debuted at no.1.</p>

			<blockquote id="death-cite"> Yoo, Noah. “XXXTentacion Shot Dead at 20” in Pitchfork, June 18, 2018,<i>Pitchfork</i>, June 18, 2018, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-shot-dead-at-20/">https://pitchfork.com/news/xxxtentacion-shot-dead-at-20/</a> </blockquote>


			<p >The story of Triple X is the story of underground rap today. Audiences want an ugly and vulnerable slice of reality and Jahseh Onfroy paid the ultimate price trying to deliver. He’s still one of the most polarizing figures in rap music. A tortured martyr for the brash and desensitized young heads and for the older generation, proof of the dangers of social media and the human toll of Instagram fame. </p>
